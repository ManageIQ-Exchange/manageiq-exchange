## How to contribute to ManageIQ Exchange

Please notice: ManageIQ Exchange consists on several repos, including one for the front end and another for the backend.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in ManageIQ Exchange**, and instead to refer to our [ManageIQ talk](http://talk.manageiq.org/). If you contact us there we will quickly respond.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/miq-consumption/manageiq-exchange/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/miq-consumption/manageiq-exchange/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue, although right now we don't have any (so you can create one)

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to ManageIQ Exchange](https://github.com/miq-consumption/manageiq-exchange/contributing.md) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [ManageIQ talk](http://talk.manageiq.org) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the code in the [ManageIQ Talk](http://talk.manageiq.org).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the ManageIQ Exchange documentation?**

* Please do it, documentation is in the wiki. We would love to have the best documentation possible.

ManageIQ is a volunteer effort.
